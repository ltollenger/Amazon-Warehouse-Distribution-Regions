This project's goal is to use python to create distribution regions for a select number of Amazon warehouses [[1]] based on each locations approximate distance to all the US ZIP codes found within a mock western sales region. The end goal
is to have a CSV file with each ZIP in the west region and the name of the closest distribution center.  Another business application of this is to determine if distribution centers are too close to one another.  For example, LAS2 and LAS6 are 
favorable locations in terms of distance for only 43 and 151 ZIP codes respectively out the total 5357 ZIP codes in the western saels region.  This information tells us that, in terms of ZIPs served, the location of Amazon warehouses could be optimized.
